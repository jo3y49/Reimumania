# Reimumania

### A game I made for Touhou Pride Game Jam 5 on Itch.io. The main purpose of this game was to gain the experience of making a game from scratch in 2 weeks in Unity. After the experience, I am now much more knowledgable on not only Unity itself, but also on what kind of workflows would be best to streamline game development. Also, I learned how code could be written in a way so it is as reusable as possible to put into other projects to save a lot of time.
